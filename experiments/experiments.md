#### Reflection ####

For this experiment I learnt some basic code and how to potentially create a circuit diagram for my replication project: The circuit for this experiment was really easy and fun to work with.

### Compass Game ###

  1. Green
  2. Blue
  3. Common
  4. Red
* 10K resistors are marked with brown, black, orange, gold.
* 47 Ohm are marked with yellow, purple, black and gold.
* How to connect a switch to the same LED, but program a different colour.

### Traffic Lights ###

#### Reflection ####

* Using block commands to create 6 outputs. 1 for the buzzer, 2 for the pedestrian lights & 3 for the traffic lights.
* This will be used for my replication project!
